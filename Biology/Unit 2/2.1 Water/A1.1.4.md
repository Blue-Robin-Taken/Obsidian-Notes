- Define the following terms: adhesion, polar, ion
	- Adhesion
		- Water sticks to a polar or charged object
	- Polar
		- Slightly positive and negative side
	- Ion
		- Charged atom, negative or positive
- Compare cation and anion.
	- Cation
		- Positively charged ion
	- Anion
		- Negatively charged ion
- Explain why water is attracted to molecules that are polar or charged. 
	- Because water is a polar molecule
- Outline the cause of capillary action
	- When the adhesive forces are stronger than the cohesive forces, the liquid flows against gravity
	- Larger the surface area, the larger the adhesive force
		- The faster it is
	- The pressure gets lower the higher it goes with capillary action
		- Trees get around this by creating negative pressure at the top of the tree
		- It doesn't boil because the tubes in the tree **only** have water (no air)
- Outline the cause and effect of capillary action in soil.
	- Cause: Water adhesion to dry soil
	- Effect: Keeps the soil water retention
