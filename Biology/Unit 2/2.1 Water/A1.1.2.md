- Describe the structure of an atom.
	- Protons
		- Positive Charge
	- Neutrons
		- No charge
	- Electrons
		- Negative charge
		- Orbit in a cloud
		- Attached to protons in the nucleus by an EMF (electro magnetic force)
		- Have different energy levels
			- Can change levels by absorbing a photon with enough energy
				- Photosynthesis
	- Ions: Atoms that have a deficit or surplus of electrons
- Outline the formation of ionic and covalent bonds between atoms.
	- Covalent Bond
		- Holds together two atoms that share one or more pair of electrons between atoms.
		- Polar
			- Shares electrons unequally
			- Will have a slightly negative and slightly positive side
		- Nonpolar
			- Shares electrons equally
	- Ionic Bond
		- Between a positively charged ion and a negatively charged ion
			- Ex: NaCl (Na+ and Cl-)
- State the location of the polar covalent bond within a water molecule.
	- Polar covalent bonds are from the oxygen and hydrogen
		- Oxygen is the slightly negative side
		- Hydrogen is the slightly positive side
		- The protons within the oxygen have a higher pull than the protons in the hydrogen, hence the oxygen side is slightly negative
- Draw a water molecule, including notation to depict the partial charges of the atoms. 
	- ![[Water and charge.png]]
- Outline the cause of the formation of hydrogen bonds between water - molecules.
	- The partial positive in one molecule is attracted to the partial negative in another molecule
	- The partial positive and partial negative create a hydrogen bond because of the presence of hydrogen
- Outline the consequences of the collective strength of hydrogen bonds - between water molecules. 
	- Hydrogen bonds are made and broken quickly **as the molecules move**
	- There are a large number of bonds, however
	- Makes the specific heat very high
	- It gives the water the following properties
		- Cohesion
		- Adhesion
		- Solvency
		- High specific heat
