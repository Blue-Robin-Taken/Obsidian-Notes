- Explain the hypothesis that asteroids are responsible for the origin of water on Earth.
	- Evidence that asteroids, comets, etc. contain large amounts of water
	- Water is required for life
	- Asteroids up to a few hundred kilometers across seem to be likely
	- Evidence:
		- Deuterium to hydrogen ratio in water
		- The above is very close to the ratio in asteroids
- State two reasons why water was retained on early Earth.
	- Earth is in the goldilocks zone
	- Earth's gravity keeps water on the planet
